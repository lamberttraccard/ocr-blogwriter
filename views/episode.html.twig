                        I am fully aware of the shortcomings in these essays. I shall not touch upon those which are
                        characteristic of first efforts at investigation. The others, however, demand a word of
                        explanation.
                        The four essays which are here collected will be of interest to a wide circle of educated
                        people, but they can only be thoroughly understood and judged by those who are really
                        acquainted
                        with psychoanalysis as such. It is hoped that they may serve as a bond between students of
                        ethnology, philology, folklore and of the allied sciences, and psychoanalysts; they cannot,
                        however, supply both groups the entire requisites for such co-operation. They will not
                        furnish
                        the former with sufficient insight into the new psychological technique, nor will the
                        psychoanalysts acquire through them an adequate command over the material to be elaborated.
                        Both
                        groups will have to content themselves with whatever attention they can stimulate here and
                        there
                        and with the hope that frequent meetings between them will not remain unproductive for
                        science.

                        The two principal themes, totem and taboo, which give the name to this small book are not
                        treated alike here. The problem of taboo is presented more exhaustively, and the effort to
                        solve
                        it is approached with perfect confidence. The investigation of totemism may be modestly
                        expressed as: “This is all that psychoanalytic study can contribute at present to the
                        elucidation of the problem of totemism.” This difference in the treatment of the two
                        subjects is
                        due to the fact that taboo still exists in our midst. To be sure, it is negatively conceived
                        and
                        directed to different contents, but according to its psychological nature, it is still
                        nothing
                        else than Kant’s ‘Categorical Imperative’, which tends to act compulsively and rejects all
                        conscious motivations. On the other hand, totemism is a religio-social institution which is
                        alien to our present feelings; it has long been abandoned and replaced by new forms. In the
                        religions, morals, and customs of the civilized races of to-day it has left only slight
                        traces,
                        and even among those races where it is still retained, it has had to undergo great changes.
                        The
                        social and material progress of the history of mankind could obviously change taboo much
                        less
                        than totemism.

                        If I judge my readers’ impressions correctly, I dare say that after hearing all that was
                        said
                        about taboo they are far from knowing what to understand by it and where to store it in
                        their
                        minds. This is surely due to the insufficient information I have given and to the omission
                        of
                        all discussions concerning the relation of taboo to superstition, to belief in the soul, and
                        to
                        religion. On the other hand I fear that a more detailed description of what is known about
                        taboo
                        would be still more confusing; I can therefore assure the reader that the state of affairs
                        is
                        really far from clear. We may say, however, that we deal with a series of restrictions which
                        these primitive races impose upon themselves; this and that is forbidden without any
                        apparent
                        reason; nor does it occur to them to question this matter, for they subject themselves to
                        these
                        restrictions as a matter of course and are convinced that any transgression will be punished
                        automatically in the most severe manner. There are reliable reports that innocent
                        transgressions
                        of such prohibitions have actually been punished automatically. For instance, the innocent
                        offender who had eaten from a forbidden animal became deeply depressed, expected his death
                        and
                        then actually died. The prohibitions mostly concern matters which are capable of enjoyment
                        such
                        as freedom of movement and unrestrained intercourse; in some cases they appear very
                        ingenious,
                        evidently representing abstinences and renunciations; in other cases their content is quite
                        incomprehensible, they seem to concern themselves with trifles and give the impression of
                        ceremonials. Something like a theory seems to underlie all these prohibitions, it seems as
                        if
                        these prohibitions are necessary because some persons and objects possess a dangerous power
                        which is transmitted by contact with the object so charged, almost like a contagion. The
                        quantity of this dangerous property is also taken into consideration. Some persons or things
                        have more of it than others and the danger is precisely in accordance with the charge. The
                        most
                        peculiar part of it is that any one who has violated such a prohibition assumes the nature
                        of
                        the forbidden object as if he had absorbed the whole dangerous charge. This power is
                        inherent in
                        all persons who are more or less prominent, such as kings, priests and the newly born, in
                        all
                        exceptional physical states such as menstruation, puberty and birth, in everything sinister
                        like
                        illness and death and in everything connected with these conditions by virtue of contagion
                        or
                        dissemination.
