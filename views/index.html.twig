                            Unless we are mistaken, the understanding of taboo also throws light upon the nature and
                            origin
                            of conscience. Without stretching ideas we can speak of a taboo conscience and a taboo sense
                            of guilt after the violation of a taboo. Taboo conscience is probably the oldest form in
                            which
                            we meet the phenomenon of conscience.

                            Taboo is itself an ambivalent word and by way of supplement we may add that the established
                            meaning of this word might of itself have allowed us to guess what we have found as the
                            result
                            of extensive investigation, namely, that the taboo prohibition is to be explained as the
                            result
                            of an emotional ambivalence. A study of the oldest languages has taught us that at one time
                            there were many such words which included their own contrasts so that they were in a certain
                            sense ambivalent, though perhaps not exactly in the same sense as the word taboo. Slight
                            vocal modifications of this primitive word containing two opposite meanings later served to
                            create a separate linguistic expression for the two opposites originally united in one word.
